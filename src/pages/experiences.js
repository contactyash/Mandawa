          <h2>Camel Safari </h2>
          <p>The camel is an amazing creature. Gentle yet occasionally cussed, the camel is the ultimate desert SUV. Lawrence of Arabia led the charge on Aqaba astride one and the nomads of Rajasthan still use them regularly to travel vast distances. Getting on to one while it's seated is quite easy, but then as it lurches to its feet in three stages the experience can be quite unnerving the first time. But once you're on and perched six feet above the ground, your perspective changes and riding into the sunset you can fantasize about global conquests or Arabian nights!</p>
          <p>Mandawa is one of the most popular circuits for Camel Safari. The gateway to the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan, where every home bears exquisitely painted wall murals. Admire the beautiful murals in the magnificent havelis (large stately homes) lining the streets of Mandawa.

            There is a reason why the state of Rajasthan is called “rangeelo” (colourful) Rajasthan. The myriad hues of the clothes of the Rajasthani Folk depict this so well. The glory of the colours is best seen in folk dances of the state. Here we give you a brief on various traditional dance forms of the state:

</p>
          <p><b>Gowari Dance </b>- The most famous art form of the Bhil tribe is the “Gowari” which is a kind of dance drama. The troupe travels from village to village to perform their dance drama. In between the drama enactments, the entire troupe dances around a central spot which is considered holy.</p>
          <p>
            <b> Ghoomar Dance </b>- The Ghoomar dance is a very famous community dance of women in Rajasthan. It is performed on various auspicious occasions like fairs & festivals, weddings and other family functions. The performers in Ghoomar dance sway in circles to a repetitive rhythm.
    Terahtali Dance - The Terahtali dance is a very fascinating and unusual dance of Rajasthan. It is considered as a devotional form of dance and it is performed by women folk in a sitting posture. It is termed as `Terahtali" as terah (thirteen) manjeeras or cymbals are used to create rhythm on which, the dancers move. Manjeeras are tied on their wrists, elbows, waists, arms and a pair in their hands as well.  Sometimes, they may hold a sword between their teeth or do the balancing act of holding of pots or lighted lamps on their heads. The Kamad community of Rajasthan is privileged to perform it.

         </p>
          <p><b>Kathputli Dance </b>- Kathputli Dance means the dance of puppets. Legends and folk tales are told through the puppets in this dance form. Sometimes men and women also enact the puppets to give the dance a little twist.
</p>
          <p><b>Kalbeliya Dance</b> - The Kalbeliyas is the snake-charmer community from Rajasthan. Theirs is one of the most popular dance forms. Performed by mostly women who bend and swirl like gymnasts, this dance form is very peppy and entertaining. The kalbeliya community relies on the performances for its livelihood.
